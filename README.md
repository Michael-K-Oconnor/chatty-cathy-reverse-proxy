# ChattyCathy Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy service powered by NGINX for ChattyCathy, a full stack chat application

## Motivation

ChattyCathy is a full stack web application that serves as a sandbox for personal exploration of different software development techniques and practices. This application has a microservice architecture with seperate services to serve React.js client-side code and Node.js backend services handling API requests with an NGINX reverse-proxy routing incoming requests.

## Installation and Setup

There are several ways to run this service.

1. Download it from the Docker image michaelkoconnor/chatty-cathy-reverse-proxy hosted on DockerHub [here](https://cloud.docker.com/u/michaelkoconnor/repository/docker/michaelkoconnor/chatty-cathy-reverse-proxy) 

2. Clone this repository and build the Docker image locally using the included Dockerfile

3. Clone the [chatty-cathy-main repository](https://github.com/Michael-K-Oconnor/chatty-cathy-main.git) and run the following command to initialize all containers required to run the ChattyCathy app locally. Note that several of the containers included in the docker-compose file require .env files which are not currently publically available

```bash
docker-compose up
```
